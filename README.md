# qwk-flask
A flask quick-start module to get building immediately 

## File tree
ðŸ“¦core 
 â”£ ðŸ“‚main
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œroutes.py
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œ__init__.py
 â”£ ðŸ“‚static

## Includes
- run file (app.py)
- templates folder - w/ base and index.html
- main blueprint for your app - initialized 
- static folder - for CSS, JS, IMG's
- models folder 
- __init__.py where the main factory function (create_app()) exists

## To do
- git clone https://github.com/Optimized-Coder/qwk-flask.git
- add .env file
    - $ git touch .env
    - set my_secret_key to your secret key

## How To DIY

### Set up your environment
In the root folder of your application, run:
```
root
$ py -m venv env
```
This will create a new virtual environment so you can access environment variables as well as keep order of your depenenies.

Then:
```
root
$ source env/Scripts/activate
```
**Note: if your are using Mac or Linux then substitute "Scripts" for "bin"**



Next, you will need to create a new file called 'app.py'. You can call it what you want but this is conventional

```
--> app.py

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello World'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, port=5050)
```

Then, if you return to your git bash terminal, and use the command:

```
$ python app.py
```

your application will run at port on your localhost server. Type either:
- 127.0.0.1:5050
- localhost:5000

into your browser and, if all is working, you should see your first application.

You're ready to start building your app with more routes and styles! 

P.S. app is set to port(5050) as I was already running :5000 on my local server at the time of building
